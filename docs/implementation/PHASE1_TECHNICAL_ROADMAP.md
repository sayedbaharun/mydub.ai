### Technical Tasks

#### Task 1.1.1: Database Schema Enhancement
**Estimated Time:** 3 days  
**Priority:** Critical (Blocking)

**Objective:** Extend Prisma schema for newsroom operations

**Files to Modify:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Create new migration: `supabase/migrations/add_editorial_workflow.sql`

**Schema Changes Required:**
```sql
-- New User Roles
enum UserRole {
  READER
  JOURNALIST
  EDITOR
  ADMIN
  PUBLISHER
}

-- Editorial Workflow States
enum ArticleStatus {
  DRAFT
  ASSIGNED
  IN_PROGRESS
  SUBMITTED
  IN_REVIEW
  APPROVED
  PUBLISHED
  ARCHIVED
}

-- Story Assignment System
model StoryAssignment {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  description String?
  deadline    DateTime
  priority    Priority @default(MEDIUM)
  assignedTo  String
  assignedBy  String
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  
  journalist  User     @relation("AssignedStories", fields: [assignedTo], references: [id])
  editor      User     @relation("EditorAssignments", fields: [assignedBy], references: [id])
  article     Article?
}

-- Enhanced Article Model
model Article {
  // Existing fields...
  status        ArticleStatus @default(DRAFT)
  assignmentId  String?
  authorId      String
  editorId      String?
  publisherId   String?
  scheduledFor  DateTime?
  breakingNews  Boolean       @default(false)
  featured      Boolean       @default(false)
  
  assignment    StoryAssignment? @relation(fields: [assignmentId], references: [id])
  author        User             @relation("AuthoredArticles", fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  editor        User?            @relation("EditedArticles", fields: [editorId], references: [id])
