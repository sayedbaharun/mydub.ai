# App Flow Document for MyDub.AI

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A new user lands on the MyDub.AI welcome screen by visiting the web URL or opening the PWA install prompt on their device. On the first screen, they choose their preferred language among Arabic, English, Hindi, and Urdu, with the interface adapting its layout for right-to-left text when Arabic is selected. After confirming language, the user sees the sign-up and sign-in options. They can opt to register with an email and password or use a social login with Google or Apple. During registration, the user indicates whether they are a resident, tourist, or business visitor, then provides basic details such as name, email, and a password. An email verification link is sent immediately, and once clicked, the user is asked to set up their profile by selecting interests, favorite districts, and notification preferences. Returning users tap “Sign In,” enter their credentials or choose social login, and land back at the profile or home feed. If they forget their password, a simple flow lets them request a reset link via email, create a new password on the reset page, and then proceed to sign in. At any point, a “Sign Out” link in the profile menu ends the session and returns the user to the welcome screen.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After signing in, the user arrives at the main dashboard, which features a full-width header at the top with a search bar and a language toggle on the right. Below the header, a horizontally scrollable navigation bar lists sections such as Government Updates, Local News, Tourism, Practical Info, Events, and Chatbot. Along the left side, a collapsible sidebar shows icons for Home, Favorites, Settings, and Help. In the center, the home feed displays a mosaic of content cards that mix live traffic maps, weather widgets, breaking news, upcoming events, and government notices. Each card is clearly labeled and time-stamped. Users scroll vertically to load more cards and can swipe horizontally within each category’s carousel. Tapping any card takes them into that feature’s detail page, and tapping the menu icon on the top left animates the sidebar open to jump to other sections. A floating chatbot icon sits at the bottom right, always available to launch the AI assistant.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When a user taps a Government Updates card, the app transitions to a dedicated page listing official announcements with a date filter and department filter at the top. As the user scrolls, new items load automatically. Choosing an announcement opens a full-screen view with sharing and bookmark buttons at the bottom. If they tap “Bookmark,” the item is saved to Favorites and visible under the Favorites tab in the sidebar. From there, tapping the back arrow returns them to the home feed.
Selecting the News section from the top navigation brings up a chronological article stream. Smart filters above let users switch between neighborhood news and nation-wide headlines. Each article card shows a headline, source logo, and a “Summary” link. Tapping Summary slides up a concise AI-generated overview, with an option to “Read Full Article” that expands inline or opens the source link. A “Save” heart icon adds it to the personal library. Back navigation always returns to the news stream with scroll position preserved.
Tourist users tapping the Tourism tab see an interactive map with pins for attractions. A list view sits below the map, showing cards for landmarks, restaurants, and cultural experiences. Each card displays hours, entry fees, user ratings, and a “Book Now” button. When “Book Now” is tapped, a third-party booking flow opens in a secure modal which then returns the user to the attraction details once complete. Adding to calendar and setting reminders happens within the same modal. Navigating back to the map or list view is immediate and returns the map viewport to the user’s last position.
In the Practical Info section, large buttons direct users to Weather, Traffic, Transit, and Emergency Services pages. The Traffic page shows a heatmap overlay from live data with pinch-to-zoom. The Transit page embeds a widget with real-time bus and metro arrivals. Emergency Services offers one-tap dialing icons for police, ambulance, and roadside assistance. Tapping any of these automatically brings up the device’s dialer.
Tapping the chatbot icon anywhere opens the AI chat interface in a full-screen overlay. At the top, avatars represent distinct mascots. The user selects a mascot to change tone and specialty, then types questions in the input field. As they chat, the assistant draws on live API data and the user’s saved preferences. Switching mascots mid-conversation instantly reloads the context with the new persona. A close button returns them to their previous screen without losing chat history.
The search icon in the header reveals an overlay where users can type natural language queries. As they type, results appear below grouped by category—government updates, news, events, and attractions. Tapping a result transitions to that feature’s detail page.
Content creators, editors, and admins sign in via the same welcome screen but see an additional Admin Dashboard link in their sidebar. Curators use the Admin Dashboard to vet incoming feeds, tag items, and schedule publications. Editors review AI-generated summaries and translations, then submit approved items for final review. System administrators access a user management area where they assign roles, configure API credentials, and monitor system health. Every approval step notifies the next role and logs actions for an audit trail.

## Settings and Account Management
In the Settings area, accessible via the sidebar, users can update personal information such as name, email, and password. A section titled Preferences lets them adjust language, time zone, and content categories. A Notifications page provides toggles for alerts on news, government advisories, weather, events, and chatbot updates. Under Privacy, users review data collection practices, enable or disable automated tracking, and manage location permissions. Subscribers or paid users see a Billing tab where they can view invoices, upgrade plans, and manage payment methods. After making changes, a “Save” button confirms updates and a toast message appears. A “Return to Home” link always takes them back to the dashboard with their previous scroll position intact.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user enters an invalid email or a weak password on sign-up, a red inline error message appears beneath the field explaining the issue. When network connectivity is lost, a full-screen error illustration prompts the user to retry, with a “Try Again” button retrying API calls. If content fails to load, a placeholder card shows an error icon and a message, and tapping it retries only that section. Unauthorized access to admin pages redirects to a “403 Forbidden” screen explaining the lack of permission, with a link back to the home feed. For expired sessions, any action triggers a modal informing the user they have been signed out, with a button to go back to the sign-in page. All error pages include clear language on how to proceed or contact support.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the moment a user visits MyDub.AI, they choose their language and role, create an account, and set up their preferences. They are then guided through a dynamic home feed that updates in real time with government updates, news, events, and practical information. Users explore detailed pages for each content category, save favorites, and interact with persona-driven AI chatbots for personalized assistance. They manage their account settings, language, notifications, and billing in a dedicated area. Administrators and editors work behind the scenes in the Admin Dashboard to curate and approve content. Along every path, error states guide the user back to a successful experience. This seamless journey—from sign-up through everyday exploration—ensures that residents and tourists alike have all of Dubai’s information at their fingertips.
