# Culinary Celebration: Experience Dubai's Finest Restaurants for Just Dhs125 This Week

An unprecedented gastronomic opportunity has arrived in Dubai as more than 100 of the city's most celebrated restaurants open their doors with special set menus priced at just Dhs125 per person. This remarkable value proposition, part of the expanded Dubai Restaurant Week, offers food enthusiasts a rare chance to experience premium dining establishments at a fraction of their usual cost.

The carefully curated restaurant collection includes numerous winners from the prestigious Time Out Dubai Restaurant Awards 2025, providing access to some of the most sought-after dining experiences in the emirate. Among the participating venues are Jun's, COYA, Hutong, and Mimi Kakushiâ€”establishments that typically command significantly higher price points for their signature offerings.

"Dubai Restaurant Week has evolved into one of our most anticipated culinary events," explained Issam Kazim, CEO of Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing. "By making exceptional dining experiences more accessible, we're showcasing the extraordinary depth and diversity of Dubai's restaurant scene to both residents and visitors."

Each participating restaurant has crafted a special multi-course menu that highlights their signature dishes and culinary philosophy. At Jun's, diners can experience Chef Kelvin Cheung's acclaimed Asian-American fusion cuisine through a three-course journey featuring his famous lobster mac and cheese and miso black cod. COYA's Peruvian-inspired offering includes their celebrated ceviche and anticuchos, while Hutong presents a selection of their award-winning Northern Chinese specialties, including their renowned dim sum and red lantern crispy soft-shell crab.

The initiative represents a win-win scenario for both diners and restaurants. Customers gain access to premium dining experiences at accessible price points, while establishments welcome new audiences who might otherwise hesitate to visit due to perceived cost barriers.

"These special menus allow us to introduce our culinary vision to guests who may be experiencing our restaurant for the first time," noted Chef Sara Mohammed of Moonrise, whose contemporary Emirati tasting menu has been adapted for the promotion. "We view this as an investment in building our customer base rather than simply a discounted offering."

The Dhs125 price point represents exceptional value, particularly at establishments where a typical dining experience might cost three to four times that amount. While beverage pairings are available at additional cost, many venues have created special non-alcoholic pairing options that remain within the promotional spirit.

Reservations have been moving quickly since the announcement, with several venues already reporting complete bookings for prime dining times. However, the initiative's organizers have ensured that each restaurant maintains adequate availability throughout the promotional period, including implementing a fair allocation system that releases additional tables daily.

The diverse selection of participating restaurants spans numerous cuisines and dining styles. From contemporary Japanese at Mimi Kakushi to modern Indian at Tresind Studio, from Mediterranean seafood at Fish Beach Taverna to avant-garde Arabic at Ninive, the promotion showcases Dubai's reputation as a global culinary destination.

Beyond the established award winners, the initiative also highlights promising newcomers to Dubai's dining scene. Recently opened venues like Carbone, Signor Sassi, and Sirali are participating, giving diners an opportunity to experience these talked-about establishments while they're still generating their initial buzz.

To enhance the experience, a dedicated mobile application has been launched allowing users to browse participating restaurants, view special menus, and make reservations directly. The app also features a gamification element where diners can earn points for each restaurant visited, with various rewards unlocked at different thresholds.

"What makes this program particularly special is the commitment from participating restaurants to deliver their authentic experience rather than a watered-down version," explained food critic Ahmed Al Marzouqi. "These are genuine representations of each establishment's culinary identity, simply presented in a more accessible format."

The promotion runs until May 26, giving diners just one week to take advantage of this exceptional opportunity. Given the overwhelming response to previous editions, early reservations are strongly recommended for those wishing to experience specific venues.

For the complete list of participating restaurants and to make reservations, diners can visit the official Dubai Restaurant Week website or download the dedicated mobile application available on both major platforms.
