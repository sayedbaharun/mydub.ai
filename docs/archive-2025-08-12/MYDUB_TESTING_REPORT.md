## Critical Blind Spots to Test

### 1. **Email Verification Flow** ⚠️
- Currently auto-confirms emails (line 21 in auth.service.ts comments mention this is for testing)
- **Action**: Verify email confirmation works in production
- **Test**: Check if SendGrid integration is properly sending verification emails

### 2. **Image Upload Security** 🔒
- Storage buckets are configured but need testing:
  - `content-images` (10MB limit, public)
  - `article-images` (10MB limit, public)
  - `user-avatars` (5MB limit, public)
  - `content-documents` (50MB limit, private)
- **Test**: Verify file type validation, size limits, and malicious file upload prevention

### 3. **Role-Based Access Control** 👥
- User roles: `user`, `subscriber`, `curator`, `editor`, `admin`
- **Test**: Verify each role can only access appropriate features
- **Critical**: Test that regular users cannot access admin endpoints

### 4. **API Rate Limiting** 🚦
- Not visible in frontend code
- **Action**: Test API endpoints for rate limiting implementation
- **Risk**: DDoS attacks, API abuse

### 5. **Password Reset Security** 🔐
- Reset flow exists at `/auth/forgot-password` and `/auth/reset-password`
- **Test**: Verify token expiration, one-time use, and secure token generation

### 6. **Content Moderation** 📋
- AI content generation exists but moderation unclear
- **Test**: How is AI-generated content reviewed before publishing?
- **Risk**: Inappropriate or false content publication

### 7. **Search Functionality** 🔍
- Search route exists at `/search`
- **Test**: SQL injection prevention, search result filtering by user permissions

### 8. **Payment/Subscription Features** 💳
- Subscriber role exists but no payment routes found
- **Question**: Is this planned or missing?

### 9. **Data Privacy Compliance** 📊
- Privacy center at `/user/privacy-center`
- Compliance dashboard at `/dashboard/compliance`
- **Test**: GDPR compliance, data export, deletion requests

### 10. **Performance Under Load** ⚡
- **Test**: How does the site handle:
  - Multiple concurrent users
  - Large image uploads
  - Heavy AI processing requests
  - Database query optimization

### 11. **Error Handling** ❌
- **Test**: 
  - Network failures
  - Invalid API responses
  - Database connection issues
  - Graceful degradation

### 12. **Mobile Responsiveness** 📱
- PWA configured but needs testing on actual devices
- **Test**: Touch interactions, offline mode, push notifications

### 13. **Security Headers** 🛡️
- CSP headers visible in server responses
- **Verify**: All security headers properly configured

### 14. **Backup and Recovery** 💾
- **Question**: Is automated backup configured in Supabase?
- **Test**: Data recovery procedures

### 15. **Analytics and Monitoring** 📈
- Google Analytics configured (ID: G-VQS64831VB)
- **Verify**: Error tracking, performance monitoring setup

## Recommended Testing Checklist

1. [ ] Create test users with each role type
2. [ ] Test complete user journey from registration to content creation
3. [ ] Verify email notifications work (welcome, password reset, etc.)
4. [ ] Test all file upload scenarios with edge cases
5. [ ] Attempt unauthorized access to admin features
6. [ ] Test search with special characters and SQL injection attempts
7. [ ] Verify AI content generation and moderation workflow
8. [ ] Test site performance with browser dev tools
9. [ ] Check all external API integrations (News API, OpenRouter, etc.)
10. [ ] Verify data can be exported and deleted per privacy requirements
11. [ ] Test offline functionality and PWA features
12. [ ] Run accessibility audits
13. [ ] Test on multiple devices and browsers
14. [ ] Verify all environment variables are properly set for production
15. [ ] Test rate limiting on all API endpoints

## Security Considerations

### API Keys in .env
- Multiple API keys exposed in .env file
- **Action**: Ensure .env is in .gitignore and keys are rotated regularly
- **Critical**: Some keys appear to be production keys

### Supabase Configuration
- Service role key has full database access
- **Verify**: This key is never exposed to frontend code
- **Test**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies are properly configured

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test admin login and dashboard functionality
2. **High Priority**: Verify email sending and user verification
3. **High Priority**: Test all file upload scenarios
4. **Medium Priority**: Complete role-based access testing
5. **Medium Priority**: Performance and load testing
6. **Low Priority**: Enhancement features like PWA notifications

## Conclusion

The application has a solid foundation with good security practices (CSP headers, role-based access, input validation). However, several areas need thorough testing before production launch, particularly around email verification, file uploads, and content moderation workflows.

The admin interface exists and should be accessible with the credentials found in the setup script. All major user flows appear to be implemented but require end-to-end testing to ensure they work correctly in production.
