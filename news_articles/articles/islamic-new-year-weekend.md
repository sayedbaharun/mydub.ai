# Extended Celebrations: Why Islamic New Year Creates a Rare Three-Day Weekend

The United Arab Emirates has officially confirmed that this year's Islamic New Year observance will be marked with an exceptional three-day weekend, offering residents an extended break during the summer season. This rare alignment of calendar events creates one of the year's most anticipated long weekends, combining religious significance with valuable leisure time for the nation's workforce.

Islamic New Year, marking the beginning of the year 1447 in the Hijri calendar, will fall on Friday, June 27, 2025. This timing creates a perfect storm for weekend extension, as it coincides with the UAE's standard Friday-Saturday weekend structure. Government authorities have announced that Sunday, June 29, will also be designated as an official holiday, effectively creating a three-day break for both public and private sector employees.

"The alignment of Islamic New Year with our weekend structure this year presents a unique opportunity to honor this significant cultural observance while also providing citizens and residents with valuable time for rest and family connection," explained Maryam Al Hashemi, Director of Holiday Planning at the Federal Authority for Government Human Resources.

The Islamic New Year, also known as Hijri New Year or Arabic New Year, commemorates the migration (Hijra) of Prophet Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE, a pivotal event in Islamic history that marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. Unlike its Gregorian counterpart, the Islamic calendar is lunar-based, consisting of 12 months but only 354 or 355 days, which explains why Islamic observances shift approximately 11 days earlier each year in relation to the Gregorian calendar.

This year's observance holds particular significance as it coincides with several other cultural initiatives across the UAE. The Ministry of Culture has announced special exhibitions at major museums throughout the country, highlighting the mathematical and astronomical brilliance that informed the creation of the Islamic calendar. Additionally, educational programs will be conducted at schools and community centers to help younger generations understand the historical importance of the Hijri calendar system.

Economic analysts predict the extended weekend will generate significant domestic tourism activity. "These three-day breaks typically boost internal tourism spending by approximately 40% compared to regular weekends," noted Khalid Al Marzouqi, Senior Economist at Emirates Investment Research. "We anticipate particular benefits for destinations like Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah, which have positioned themselves as ideal short-break destinations."

Hotels across the UAE have reported a surge in bookings following the announcement, with many properties in Dubai and Abu Dhabi launching special packages designed specifically for the three-day break. The hospitality sector views these periodic long weekends as vital revenue opportunities, particularly during traditionally slower summer months.

For residents, the extended break offers welcome respite during the challenging summer heat. "Having three consecutive days allows for more meaningful travel options," shared Dubai resident Fatima Al Suwaidi. "We're planning a family trip to the mountains in Ras Al Khaimah where the temperatures are more moderate, something that wouldn't be practical during a standard two-day weekend."

The Ministry of Human Resources has issued guidelines to private sector organizations regarding the holiday entitlement, confirming that all employees should receive the day off with full pay in accordance with federal labor regulations. Companies providing essential services are permitted to maintain operations with appropriate compensation arrangements for working staff.

As the date approaches, cultural institutions across the UAE are finalizing programs that blend educational content with entertainment, ensuring the religious and historical significance of Islamic New Year is celebrated alongside the recreational aspects of the extended weekend. Major malls and entertainment destinations have announced special operating hours to accommodate the anticipated increase in leisure activity throughout the three-day period.
