# Official Calendar: UAE Confirms Islamic New Year Holiday for June 27

The United Arab Emirates has officially announced that the Islamic New Year holiday for 2025 will fall on Friday, June 27, creating an extended weekend for workers across all sectors nationwide. This eagerly anticipated announcement from the Federal Authority for Government Human Resources confirms the date when the nation will transition to the Hijri year 1447.

According to the official declaration, all government entities, private sector organizations, and educational institutions will observe the holiday, giving employees and students a day off to mark this significant cultural and religious occasion. With the holiday falling on a Friday, which is already part of the UAE's standard weekend, the workweek will effectively conclude on Thursday, June 26, with normal operations resuming on Monday, June 30.

"The Islamic New Year represents a moment of profound significance in our cultural calendar," stated His Excellency Abdullah bin Mohammed Al Nuaimi, Minister of Human Resources and Emiratisation. "This observance honors our heritage while providing our workforce with an opportunity for reflection and rejuvenation."

The Islamic New Year marks the beginning of the Hijri calendar, which commemorates the migration (Hijra) of Prophet Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE. Unlike the Gregorian calendar, the Islamic calendar follows a lunar system of 12 months comprising 354 or 355 days, which explains why Islamic holidays shift approximately 11 days earlier each year when viewed through the lens of the Gregorian calendar.

This year's observance holds particular significance as it coincides with several national initiatives promoting cultural heritage awareness. The Ministry of Culture and Youth has announced special programming across cultural institutions nationwide, including exhibitions highlighting the mathematical and astronomical innovations that informed the development of the Islamic calendar system.

For the business community, the holiday announcement provides welcome clarity for operational planning. "Having these dates confirmed well in advance allows businesses to adjust schedules, plan staffing, and ensure service continuity," noted Fatima Al Jassim, Director of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce's Business Support Division. "This predictability benefits both employers and employees."

Tourism and hospitality sectors are particularly attentive to the holiday calendar, as these periods typically see increased domestic tourism and leisure activity. Hotels across the UAE have already begun promoting special packages designed around the extended weekend, with many reporting substantial early bookings.

"The Islamic New Year weekend traditionally sees a 35-40% increase in domestic tourism activity," explained Khalid Al Marzouqi, tourism analyst at Emirates Tourism Board. "With this year's holiday creating a three-day weekend, we anticipate even stronger performance across hospitality venues nationwide."

For UAE residents, the announcement has been well received as it provides an opportunity to plan family activities and short getaways. "Having these dates confirmed early helps tremendously with family planning," shared Abu Dhabi resident Mariam Al Hashemi. "We've already booked a desert resort for the weekend as these places fill quickly during holiday periods."

Educational institutions have also welcomed the clarity, with schools incorporating the date into their academic calendars. Many schools are planning special educational activities in the days leading up to the holiday, helping students understand the cultural and historical significance of the Islamic New Year.

The Federal Authority for Government Human Resources has issued comprehensive guidelines to ensure consistent implementation across all sectors, including provisions for essential service workers who may need to work during the holiday period. These employees are entitled to compensatory benefits in accordance with UAE labor regulations.

As the date approaches, municipalities across the seven emirates will organize various community events celebrating the occasion, including traditional performances, educational seminars, and family-oriented activities designed to strengthen community bonds while honoring this important cultural milestone.
